                <h2 class="h2-camp">Introduction</h2>
                <p class="sub-intro-camp">This is a very addictive game, especially for people who like strategy games. It's a very complicated, well-designed game that takes a long time to learn. I personally had
                    to watch over 5 hours of tutorials before I even lauched the game for the first time. Trade, army composition, aggressive expansion, overextension and many, many other mechanics that even after
                    playing for 2 years, I still learn something new every time I play a new nation. On top of that, the game gets regularly updated with new DLCs every 1-2 years, so just when you think you've learnt
                    everything about it, some new features and changes come out that you have to learn.</p>
                <p class="sub-intro-camp">Once you start a campaign, you can lose track of how much time you spend playing the game, and you just forget yourself. I have over 1000 hours in this game,
                    and I'm only considered a beginner, there are people out there with over 4000 hours played. So because of that, I can't really write about all of my campaigns, instead, I'm going to only talk
                    about my top 5 favorite ones.</p>

                <p class="aside">These are my top favorite campaigns I've had in EU4. I didn't include any details on how I did any of them, just a wide overview of the whole campaign, as it would 
                    take more than just a paragraph to include the walkthrough for every campaign.</p>

                <article id="article-camp">
                    <h3 id="Milan"><span class="num">5. </span>Milan</h3>
                    <p class="camp-para">Started in the HRE, which I later left when the shadow kingdom event happened, allied austria (as one does when you play in the HRE), I successfully conquered my neighbors, 
                        little by little, from the rich Venice, to the Papal States, and the other small nations, like Sienna, Lucca, Savoy and others, untill I formed Italy, a little over 100 years after the start. Then,
                        I started trying my luck, successfully, against stronger nations, like Spain, to take the rest of Italy, France and later the Ottomans. I later formed the Roman Empire after taking all of France, 
                        Spain, the Balkans, Anatolia, North Africa and some major cities in Great Britain and the HRE.</p>
                    <h3 id="Prussia"><span class="num">4. </span>Brandenburg</h3>
                    <p class="camp-para">Also starts in the HRE, but in the north east. A German country that starts off weak, but has major potential to be the strongest country in the game. It's a bit harder than Milan,
                        since it's in the heart of the HRE, surounded by Poland, (which I allied) and Scandanavia, the only place to go is west, and I did. I formed the country of Prussia as soon as I could, but that still 
                        wasn't enough to reach the full potential. IO only did that after I took about 3 military ideas, which combined with the Prussian national ideas and militarisation mechanic, made me invincible. Which 
                        I took advantage of to conquer all of Germany and Poland, and reached Constantinople.</p>
                    <h3 id="Morocco"><span class="num">3. </span>Morocco</h3>
                    <p class="camp-para">What makes Morocco great is the endless possibilities. You can form Andalusia by taking over Iberia, colonise the Americas and/or Africa, you can unite the Islamic world. Morocco 
                        has a very shaky start, with the country divided into a few vassals that are somewhat unloyal, with the Iberian powers to the north still not yet done with the reconquista, with Portugal even owning 
                        one of the northern cities. I allied Tunis and conquered what I could in North Africa, because I knew that the Iberians could attack me any minute. But luckily I allied France and the Ottomans, who
                        were enemies of Castile, and focused on my navy, since there's a sea between Iberia and Morocco. Anytime they attacked me, I just used my navy to block their armies crossing all at once, and kept 
                        killing off their smaller armies until I won. Eventually I conquered all of Iberia and colonised most of South America.</p>
                    <h3 id="Byzantium"><span class="num">2. </span>Byzantium</h3>
                    <p class="camp-para">The country starts in an aweful position, surrounded by the strongest country in the game, the Ottomans, and one of the richest, Venice. Nobody wants to be your ally or help you,
                        but one thing is for sure; the Ottomans are going to attack you to take your capital city, Constantinople. In order to succeed, you need to ally anyone you can, and that's what I did. I allied the Knights,
                        since it's always hard for any country at the start to siege down an Island fort, and some other balkan minor countries. Took out so many loans and recruited so many mercenaries. But most importantly, 
                        I built Galleys, and a lot of them. The key, just like with Morocco against the Iberians, is to block the strait, so even though the Ottomans have the best army, it won't matter if they can't reach you.
                        I just blockaded the strait and took, with the help of my few allies, the Balkan territories. After that was done, the Ottomans had so much war exhaustion that I could take any lands I wanted from them in 
                        the peace treaty. That was it, the most important war as Byzantium is the first one against the Ottomans, then it's smooth sailing from there.</p>
                    <h3 id="Granada"><span class="num">1. </span>Granada</h3>
                    <p class="camp-para">This is not only my favorite, but it's also the hardest campaign I've ever done in this game. You start at the worst possible location, in the south of Iberia, as a muslim country in a catholic
                        land. The reconquista isn't over yet, and you are the next target. As opposed to Morocco and Byzantium, there is no water between Granada and it's predators, so what I did was, I allied Morocco and Tunisia,
                        and attacked a small north African country, that way I had a few more lands, which means a bigger army. But that still wasn't enough. Castile, Portugal and Aragon all attacked me multiple times, and it was 
                        always hard. I was allied to the Ottomans, but they are far away, it takes years for their army to reach Iberia, but I relied on my forts, as they are always hard to siege, and just waited for the right moment
                        to strike. Later I allied France, who hated Castile, and Naples, and kept taking away Iberia little by little, country by country, war after war, untill I formed Andalusia.</p>
