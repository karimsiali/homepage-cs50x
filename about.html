                    <p class="sub-h1-about">Here you can learn more about the game mechanics and how it's played. I will only explain the main idea of the game and will not go into detail on how to play. For that
                        you should visit the <a href="https://eu4.paradoxwikis.com/Europa_Universalis_4_Wiki" target="_blank">EU4 Wiki.</a>

            <h2 class="h2-about">Game Mechanics</h2>
            <p class="article-para">You start by picking a country in the year 1444, any country, on any continent. You can then start developing by building an army and navy, although it's worth 
                noting that for most countries, navy doesn't really matter, as the country focuses more on land battles, and navies are better used to trade or if you're playing an island country,
                like Great Britain or Malaya... You can also develop your cities to get more money, or as they're called in the game, ducats, or even to get more manpower in order to train your army,
                as you can only have a limited amount of manpower, depending on how many cities you have.
            </p>
            <p class="article-para">When playing countries such as England, Castile, Portugal or any country on the atlantic, you may want to start preparing to discover and colonise the Americas
                your rivals start doing it too, it's always good to start early. How do you prepare for that? Well you might want to check the <a href="#ideas" class="ideas">ideas</a> part to know more.
                But the main thing to remember is, no matter if you want to colonise, conquer or just play a chill relaxing campaign, you always have to keep your technologies up to date, or even better,
                 be ahead of your neighbors, that ay even if they have a bigger military, your army will always be more advanced, and hence, stronger.</p>
            <p class="article-para">Institutions are necessary to advance in this game, it's what keeps technology cost at bay. In order to spawn institutions, you must either be next to a country
                that already has that institution, or spawn it manually by developing your cities.</p>
            <p class="article-para">The most important resource in the game is not ducats, ducats are actually the least imprtant resource, as there are always ways to get more, by taking loans or 
                winning wars and taking your enemies ducats or any of the many other ways. The most important resources are monarch points. There are three types of monarcg points, administrative,
                 diplomatic and military points. These are the things you use to develop your cities, advance your technologies or taking ideas. The number of those points you get monthly depends 
                 on how good your ruler is, so you can't buy them.</p>

            <h2 class="h2-about">Idea Groups</h2>
            <p class="table-p">There are three different types of idea groups, Admin, Diplo and Military, each has its own uses and benifits, just remember to not focus on only one thing and keep 
                a balance between the three, especially the admin and military idea groups.</p>

                        <td><p>These idea types are mainly used for developing and managing your internal affairs, such as improving your economy, promoting cultures withing your country, decrease national 
                            unrest, converting your provinces to your desired religion... So basically, it helps you keep internal peace after you go to war. Note that these ideas are always the best ones 
                            to take, they're mostly good with a few bad ones here and there.</p></td>

                        <td><p>These are the least useful ones, except for a few great ones, that help you keep good relations with your neighbors and allies, and and decrease the chance of coalitions, 
                            otherwise they mostly focus on trade and colonising, so for most people 2 to 3 diplomatic idea groups are more than enough.</p></td>

                        <td><p>If you're someone who likes to go to war a lot, then military idea groups might be your friends. You can make your army bigger, or better or both, you can take ideas that 
                            makes sieging down forts less painfull. But take care not to focus only on military, as militaries need money to work, so it's always best to keep a balance between economy and 
                            military, with a bit of diplomacy once in a while.</p></td>
